    question: "Does getting your period hurt?",
    answer: "Some people experience cramps or discomfort during their period, while others might not feel any pain at all. Everyone's body is different. If you do have cramps, there are many ways to help feel better, like using a heating pad, gentle exercise, or taking pain medicine (with an adult's help)."

  {
    question: "What if I get my period at school?",
    answer: "It's a good idea to be prepared by keeping some pads or period products in your backpack or locker. If you get your period unexpectedly, you can ask a teacher, school nurse, or friend for help. Most school bathrooms also have dispensers where you can get pads or tampons, or you might be able to get one from the nurse's office."
  },
  {
    question: "Can people tell when I have my period?",
    answer: "No, people cannot tell just by looking at you that you have your period. Period products are designed to be discreet and comfortable. As long as you change your pad or tampon regularly, there shouldn't be any visible signs. Remember, having a period is a normal, natural process that roughly half the world's population experiences!"
  },
  {
    question: "Can I go swimming during my period?",
    answer: "Yes! You can definitely go swimming during your period. If you want to swim, you might prefer to use a tampon or menstrual cup, as pads aren't designed to be worn in water. The water pressure actually helps prevent blood from flowing while you're in the pool."
  },
  {
    question: "Why do I feel so emotional during my period?",
    answer: "Hormone changes during your menstrual cycle can affect your mood and emotions. You might feel more sensitive, irritable, or sad. These feelings are completely normal and temporary. Taking care of yourself with enough rest, good food, and activities you enjoy can help. Remember, it's okay to feel your feelings!"
  },
  {
    question: "Is it normal to have clots in period blood?",
    answer: "Yes, it's normal to see some small clumps or clots in your period blood, especially on heavier flow days. Period blood isn't just bloodâ€”it also contains tissue from the lining of your uterus, which can form small clots. As long as the clots aren't bigger than a quarter and you're not in severe pain, they're considered normal."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know which period product is right for me?",
    answer: "Finding the right period product often involves some trial and error. Many people start with pads because they're easy to use. As you get more comfortable, you might want to try different options like tampons, period underwear, or menstrual cups. Consider your comfort level, activities (like swimming), and how heavy your flow is. It's perfectly fine to use different products for different situations!"
  },
  {
    question: "What if my period is late or irregular?",
    answer: "When you first start having periods, it's very common for them to be irregular. It can take up to 2-3 years for your cycle to become regular. Stress, changes in weight, exercise, and many other factors can also affect your cycle. If you're concerned about your period being very late or very irregular, it's a good idea to talk to a trusted adult or healthcare provider."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I still play sports or exercise during my period?",
    answer: "Absolutely! You can and should continue all your regular activities during your period, including sports and exercise. In fact, physical activity can help reduce cramps and boost your mood. Just use the period product that makes you feel most comfortable and confident."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a normal amount of bleeding?",
    answer: "The amount of bleeding varies from person to person. On average, people lose about 2-3 tablespoons of blood during their period, though it can seem like more. Your flow is usually heavier on the first couple of days and then gets lighter. If you need to change your pad or tampon more often than every 2 hours, or if your period lasts more than 7 days, it's a good idea to talk to a healthcare provider."
